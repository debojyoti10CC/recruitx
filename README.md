Recruitix Live Integrity System  
### A Parameterized and Deterministic Framework for Robust AI-Driven Assessment and Integrity Validation  

---

## 🚀 Overview
**Recruitix** is an AI-driven online assessment and proctoring platform designed to ensure **fairness**, **reproducibility**, and **integrity** in remote evaluations.  
Unlike traditional AI-based testing systems that rely on random logic or opaque algorithms, Recruitix introduces a **deterministic**, **parameterized**, and **auditable** framework for technical, HR, and live interview assessments.

The system combines **semantic grading**, **behavioral simulation**, and **live integrity monitoring** to create a transparent, explainable, and ethical AI evaluation environment.  
Recruitix can be used by **academic institutions**, **corporate recruiters**, and **certification agencies** for secure, large-scale, and unbiased assessments.

## 🧩 Key Features
- ✅ **Deterministic Evaluation Engine** – Produces identical results for identical inputs, ensuring full reproducibility.  
- ✅ **Semantic Similarity Scoring** – Uses Jaccard similarity and keyword weighting for accurate conceptual grading.  
- ✅ **HR Simulation Engine** – Implements deterministic behavioral models for candidate profiling.  
- ✅ **Parameterized Proctoring System** – Monitors live video and event data to detect integrity violations.  
- ✅ **Secure Firebase Backend** – Authentication, real-time database, and safe environment-based credential handling.  
- ✅ **Responsive Web Interface** – Developed using React + TypeScript with Framer Motion and Shadcn UI.  
- ✅ **Explainable and Auditable AI** – Every score, deduction, and event is logged for transparency.
